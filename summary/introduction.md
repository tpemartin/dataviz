## Overview

The introduction establishes the dual challenge of data visualization: it must be scientifically accurate *and* aesthetically pleasing. It outlines the three-part structure of the book and introduces a classification system — ugly, bad, and wrong — for labeling problematic figures throughout the text.

## Learning Objectives

1. Understand that effective visualization requires balancing scientific accuracy with good aesthetics.
2. Learn the book's three-part organizational structure (data → visualization, figure design principles, miscellaneous topics).
3. Be able to distinguish between ugly, bad, and wrong figures based on aesthetic, perceptual, or mathematical problems.

## Key Takeaways

- **Accuracy comes first:** A visualization that misrepresents data values (e.g., truncated axes that distort proportions) is objectively *wrong* regardless of how attractive it looks.
- **Aesthetics matter:** Poor color choices, cluttered layouts, or distracting elements make otherwise correct figures *ugly* or *bad*, reducing the reader's ability to extract the intended message.
- **Three categories of problematic figures:**
  - **Ugly** — aesthetically unpleasant but otherwise accurate and informative.
  - **Bad** — perceptually misleading or confusing (e.g., independent y-axis scales on grouped bars).
  - **Wrong** — mathematically incorrect (e.g., bars without a zero baseline implying wrong relative sizes).
- **Organization by message type:** The book groups visualizations by the type of message they convey (amounts, distributions, proportions, relationships, trends, uncertainty) rather than by statistical data type, which better reflects how practitioners think.
- **Scope:** The book focuses on static visualizations for print, online, and slides. Interactive visuals and animations are outside its primary scope.
