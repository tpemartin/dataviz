## Overview

Figures and tables are only as useful as the text that accompanies them. This chapter covers conventions for figure titles and captions, axis and legend labeling, and best practices for formatting data tables. It distinguishes between stand-alone figures (which need self-contained titles) and figures embedded in documents (where the caption serves as the title).

## Learning Objectives

1. Write effective figure captions that begin with a brief title sentence and provide sufficient context for the figure to be understood independently.
2. Label all axes with descriptive names and measurement units, and format legends to minimize the reader's cognitive effort.
3. Format data tables for maximum readability by following typographic best practices (alignment, spacing, ruled lines).

## Key Takeaways

- **Figure titles go in captions, not on the figure:** In a published document, the caption begins with a short descriptive title followed by explanatory text. Placing a title directly on the figure creates redundancy. For stand-alone figures (presentations, social media), a title on the figure may be needed.
- **The caption title should state the message:** A good caption title tells the reader what to take away from the figure (e.g., "Population growth was fastest in western states") rather than just describing what is plotted (e.g., "Population growth by state").
- **All quantitative axes need titles and units:** An axis labeled "Temperature" is ambiguous; "Temperature (°C)" or "Temperature (°F)" is complete. Never omit units for quantitative axes.
- **Legends should be ordered meaningfully:** Order legend entries to match their visual arrangement in the figure (e.g., order matching the top-to-bottom order of lines in a line chart). Match colors and symbols in the legend exactly.
- **Tables: captions go above, figures below:** By typographic convention, table captions appear above the table (the opposite of figure captions, which appear below). This is easy to overlook.
- **Good table design:** Avoid vertical lines and excessive horizontal lines. Left-align text; right-align numbers; align decimal points. Use appropriate spacing between rows for readability. Highlight key rows or columns subtly using light shading rather than bold borders.
