## Overview

A technically correct and aesthetically polished figure still fails if it does not communicate a clear message. This chapter discusses how to structure a data visualization as a narrative — with a single focused message, appropriate context, and deliberate sequencing — so that the reader receives and retains the intended insight.

## Learning Objectives

1. Identify the single most important message a figure should convey and design the figure to foreground that message.
2. Use narrative structure (context → conflict → resolution) and figure sequencing to guide the reader to the intended conclusion.
3. Apply emphasis, annotation, and ordering to direct the viewer's attention to the key insight.

## Key Takeaways

- **Every figure should make one clear point:** Before creating a visualization, articulate in one sentence the message you want to convey. Design every element of the figure to support that message; remove or de-emphasize elements that distract from it.
- **Narrative structure improves impact:** Effective data stories follow a structure similar to good writing: establish context (what is being measured and why it matters), introduce a tension or question, and resolve it with the data.
- **Opening figures need more context than later figures:** In a sequence of figures (e.g., in a paper or presentation), the first figure must orient the reader; subsequent figures can assume more background knowledge and focus on specific findings.
- **Use sequencing deliberately:** In a presentation, showing figures one at a time (or revealing parts of a figure progressively) allows you to build up complexity and guide the audience step by step. Don't show the full conclusion before the reader has understood the setup.
- **Annotation and emphasis guide attention:** Arrows, labels, highlighted regions, and callouts direct the reader's eye to the most important part of the figure. Use these tools sparingly — one or two well-placed annotations are more effective than many.
- **A figure without a story is just a picture:** Data visualizations are communication tools. A figure that requires the reader to independently figure out what it means has partially failed. The designer's job is to make the intended message as clear as possible.
