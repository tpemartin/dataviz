## Overview

The preface sets the tone and purpose of the book. It argues that making compelling data visualizations is an essential skill for scientists, analysts, and anyone who prepares technical documents. Just as writers develop "ear" for good prose, visualization practitioners must develop "eye" for good figures — an ability that can be learned through study and practice.

## Learning Objectives

1. Understand that good visualization is a learnable skill, not an innate talent, developed through repeated exposure and critical thinking.
2. Recognize the importance of automation and reproducibility in scientific figure preparation.
3. Appreciate that the principles in this book are software-independent and applicable to any plotting tool.

## Key Takeaways

- **Develop your "eye":** The ability to judge whether a figure works — whether it is balanced, clear, and compelling — is built gradually over years, not from reading a single book.
- **Automate figure generation:** Figures should be produced programmatically as part of the data analysis pipeline, ready for print without manual post-processing. Manual editing in tools like Adobe Illustrator makes figures irreproducible.
- **Avoid interactive-only tools:** Interactive plotting programs (including Excel) force manual work and should not be used for serious scientific figures.
- **Software is incidental:** The book's concepts apply regardless of whether you use R/ggplot2, Python/matplotlib, or any other tool. The software is just the medium.
- **Iterate and stay open to change:** Good visualization judgment evolves over time. Be willing to revise your thinking as you gain experience.
