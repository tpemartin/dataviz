# Chapter 4 — Directory of Visualizations

**Source file:** `directory_of_visualizations.Rmd`  
**Part I: From Data to Visualization**

## Overview

This chapter serves as a visual reference guide — a directory — that catalogs common plot types organized by the type of data they show and the message they convey. It covers plots for amounts, distributions, proportions, x–y relationships, geospatial data, and uncertainty, providing a quick look-up resource for choosing the right chart type.

## Learning Objectives

1. Be familiar with the broad landscape of visualization types available for different data structures and analytical goals.
2. Match a given data scenario (e.g., comparing amounts across categories, showing a distribution, displaying proportions) to one or more appropriate chart types.
3. Use this directory as a quick reference when deciding how to visualize a particular dataset.

## Key Takeaways

- **Amounts:** Bar plots (grouped, stacked, or faceted) and dot plots are the primary tools for showing discrete quantities. Order categories by value to facilitate comparisons.
- **Distributions:** Histograms, density plots, box plots, violin plots, and strip charts reveal the shape, spread, and central tendency of a variable's distribution.
- **Proportions:** Pie charts, stacked bar charts, and mosaic plots show part-to-whole relationships. Stacked bars work better than pies when comparing across multiple groups.
- **x–y relationships:** Scatter plots, bubble charts, line graphs, correlograms, and heat maps capture associations and correlations between two or more quantitative variables.
- **Geospatial data:** Choropleth maps, cartograms, and point maps translate location-referenced data onto geographic space.
- **Uncertainty:** Error bars, confidence bands, ridgeline plots, and quantile dot plots communicate the variability and reliability of estimates.
- **No single "best" chart:** The right visualization depends on what message you want to convey, how many variables are involved, and the size of the dataset. This directory helps narrow down sensible options quickly.
